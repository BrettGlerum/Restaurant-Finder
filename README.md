# Restaurant-Find

# Description 

This project is a functional restaurant finder that uses the Google maps, Google routes, and Google places to find the top three rated restaurants in the area. This is a project between Brett Glerum, Maria Ramirez, Jake Waller, Nevin Lewis, Jared Kim, and Jonathan Vera. Jake Waller and Jonathan Vera created the Javascript, Nevin Lewis found and called the APIs, Jared Kim handled all the HTML elements and pages, Maria Ramirez implemented tailwind CSS into the HTML, and Brett Glerum oversaw the project and created the presentation. The HTML includes numerous sections and boxes, with tailwind embedded into the HTML elements. The Javascript calls the APIs, puts them in local storage, and then grabs the data from local storage and displays them on the results page.

# Usage

The title of this website is called "Restaurant Finder". There is a text box at the top where the user inputs their city or address, then they can use the sliders below to adjust the distance and price range of the restaurants they want. They are then able to input a keyword, like "coffee" or "pizza", and then they can press the "FIND" button to go to the next page. The next page is the results page and displays three restaurants that fit those parameters in the center. To the left of that is an interactive google map that shows the route from the inputted location to the restaurant clicked. To the right of the results is step-by-step directions to get to that location as well.
